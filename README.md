## LiAmazons

LiAmazons is an open-source, online platform inspired by lichess (Libre Chess), but to play the [Game of the Amazons](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Game_of_the_Amazons). The platform is made to be free to play, with no additional paywalled features.

This website was built using the frontend [Solid js](https://www.solidjs.com) framework, which enables, as the website describes it, a "simple and performant reactivity for building user interfaces." This framework is similar to React, currently the most popular frontend framework worldwide, as it is powered by JSX, but under the hood ditches the virtual DOM to unlock better peforming websites and an easier to reason about developer experience.

The logic of the game itself is handled by the [amazons-game-engine](https://www.npmjs.com/package/amazons-game-engine) npm package, which is also open source, while [boardgame.io](https://boardgame.io) is used to handle the multiplayer aspect of game.

This project is under active developent. A version accesible to everyone is soon to be available.
